Each script in this repository correspond to the following described analyses that are included in the manucript.

calc.cv.R: Calculates coefficients of variation for each of the clades in our analyses

cor.test.R: Calculates the mean rates of chromosome number evolution for genera, obtains the matching scaled coefficients of variation and performs a correlation test for the scaled variance-based estimates of karyotype evolution nd the phylogentic model-based rate estimates for the nine caldes with overlapping analyses

genera.phylo.R: calculates the rate of chromosome number evolution for each of the Coleoptera genera in our analyses

genera.wo.poly.R: calculates the rate of chromosome number evoulution for winged and wingless Coleoptera genera in our analyses. The model in this analysis includes fission and fusion only

genera.wpoly.R: calculates the rate of chromosome number evoulution for winged and wingless Coleoptera genera in our analyses. The model in this analysis includes fission, fusion, and polyploidy

wingless.R: calculates the rate of chromosome number evolution for wingless Coleoptera genera in our analyses. This script includes analyzing a model both with and without polyploidy
