coding of dispersal power coded as in phytools and diversitree with tips states
represented by a probability matrix with each row summing to one.

if data available for species coded directly
macopterous 1,0 
submacopterous = .5,.5
brachyopterous 0,1 

in cases where no data was available for species on the tree but (multiple) other
species in the same genus were available in the dispersal dataset the 
proportions in the dispersal data set were used to set probabilities for 
all tips in that group. for instance: 
Amara sp1 macopterous
Amara sp2 macopterous
Amara sp3 macopterous
Amara sp7 brachyopterous

leads to a tip state annotation of:
Amara sp2 1, 0
Amara sp5 .75, .25
Amara sp6 .75, .25
Amara sp7 0, 1
Amara sp8 .75, .25
